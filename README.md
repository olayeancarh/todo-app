# TodoApp

**A Dynamic To-Do List Built with Angular**

TodoApp is a simple yet powerful to-do list application built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/). It demonstrates core Angular concepts like components, data binding, event handling, and state management using TypeScript and Local Storage. Users can add, delete, toggle, and mark all tasks as completed, with data persisting across sessions.

## ✨ Features
- **Add Tasks**: Create new to-do items with a simple input.
- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks in a clean, interactive list.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark All Completed**: Complete all tasks with one click.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in Local Storage.
